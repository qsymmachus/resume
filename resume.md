#### Skills

I'm a versatile engineer who has worked most recently on distributed backend systems. I like working on horizontal teams whose tools impact an entire organization. I am a force multiplier who delivers impactful software, builds strong teams, and collaborates effectively with all kinds of people.

Technologies I've built with:

* __Used recently__: `Go, Scala, Kubernetes/Helm, GCP, Thrift & gRPC, PostgreSQL`
* __Used less recently__: `Typescript/Node, React/Redux, Ruby/Rails, Apache Beam, Kafka, MySQL`

Problems I've solved:

* Built services (both RPC and event driven) that serve __tens of millions of requests__ a day.
* Led __complex projects__ collaborating across many teams and delivering measurable results. 
* Crafted __successful rollout strategies__ to confidently replace high-value legacy systems.
* Mentored junior team members to __multiply their impact__ and accelerate their growth.
