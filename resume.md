#### Skills

I'm a versatile engineer who has worked most recently on distributed back-end systems in a variety of domains. I aim to be a force multiplier by leading technical design, building strong teams, and collaborating effectively with all kinds of interesting people.

Here's a representative list of the technologies I've worked with:

* __Used recently__: `Go, Scala/Finagle, Kubernetes/Helm, Thrift & gRPC, MySQL`
* __Used less recently__: `Typescript/Node, Ruby/Rails, React/Redux, Scheme, Elixir, Kafka, PostgreSQL`

Being a great engineer requires more than pure technical skills, especially at the senior level. Here are some I think are important:

* __Project management__: I have experience leading technical projects from start to finish. I enjoy collaborating with other teams and non-technical coworkers to solve shared problems. I also leave my ego out of it.
* __Why, not just how__: The best code is code that doesn't have to be written. I aim to prioritize work that will have the highest impact.
* __Collaboration__: Engineers work in teams – I do my best work when I increase the impact of my teammates. I regularly mentor those who can learn from me, and seek out mentorship from those who can teach me.

#### Experience

##### Senior Software Engineer II, Credit Karma 2019/06 – present
* Twice the power of an ordinary senior software engineer(?)
* Lead engineer on the dev efficiency team, a group of force multipliers building tools that speed up software development across the company.
* Currently building powerful and elegant tools that allow teams to manage their service deployments on a Kubernetes cluster.
  * Blue/green deploys, service scaling, job management, and more through a slick web UI and CLI.

##### Senior Software Engineer, Credit Karma, 2017/03 – 2019/05
* Built a performant, distributed system for selecting, rendering, and sending notifications (email and push notifications).
* My design tripled notification throughput and daily volume, at half the cost.
* Lead engineer within the team: I multiplied the impact of my team members by
  * Spearheading the design of new services,
  * Learning new technologies when needed, and sharing that knowledge with the team,
  * Collaborating with other senior and staff engineers to align company-wide engineering goals.
