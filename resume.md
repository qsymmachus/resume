### Skills

At the end of the day, I'm more interested in the problem I'm solving than the tool I'm using to do it. Having said that, here's a representative list of the tools I use:

* __Used recently__: `Scala/Finagle, Typescript/Node, Thrift, MySQL`
* __Used less recently__: `Ruby/Rails, React/Redux, PHP, Scheme, Elixir, Kafka, PostgreSQL`

Being a great engineer requires more than pure technical skills, especially at the senior level. Here are some I think are important:

* __Project management__: I have experience leading technical projects from start to finish. I've used scrum, kanban, and XP methodologies.
* __Why, not just how__: The best code is code that doesn't have to be written. I aim to prioritize work that will have the highest impact.
* __Collaboration__: Engineers work in teams. I do my best work when I multiply the impact of my teammates.
